This project aims to investigate the genre preference of each gender among the most popular and highest rated movies, as well as the industriesâ€™ most produced year and its movie genres.  

Steps for Data Preprocessing, Data Analysis and Data Visualization:
1. The datasets obtained from Movielens were imported as readable formats into SAS Studio and Google Collaboratory-Python
2. The datasets were cleaned and validated to ensure that missing values and duplicates are no longer in the dataset. 
3. After that, the datasets were explored and manipulated with the research questions in mind. 
4. Finally, the resulting statistics were visualised in tables and graphs in SAS Studio.
